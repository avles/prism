# PRISM - Performance and Resilience Index for Software-delivery Maturity

a. What is this framework?

PRISM: Performance and Resilience Insights for Software Maturity is a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate and enhance the maturity and performance of software delivery teams. It stands on seven key pillars: 
- Team Organization
- Developer Enablement
- Delivery Flow
- Rugged Score
- Chaos Tolerance
- Ops Capability
- Team Elasticity

By assessing these core areas, PRISM provides actionable insights and metrics to guide teams toward achieving high performance and resilience in software delivery.

b. Why was this created?

PRISM was created to address the common challenges faced by diverse organizations in building and maintaining high-performing, resilient software delivery teams. Despite numerous playbooks and frameworks, there is no universally accepted method to achieve this goal. Drawing on extensive experience across various industries, PRISM aims to fill this gap by providing a structured, holistic approach to evaluate and improve team maturity, ensuring that all critical aspects of software delivery are covered.

c. How does this help?

PRISM helps organizations by:

Evaluating Maturity: Offering a clear, structured evaluation of a team's current maturity across seven critical aspects.
Identifying Improvement Areas: Highlighting specific areas that need enhancement, from tools and processes to team dynamics and operational capabilities.
Providing Actionable Insights: Supplying metrics and KPIs that guide teams in implementing foundational practices for improvement.
Enhancing Performance: Fostering a culture of continuous improvement, resilience, and excellence in software delivery.
Ensuring Comprehensive Coverage: Covering all critical aspects of software delivery to avoid overlooking any potential weaknesses or growth areas.

d. How is this different?

- Holistic Approach: PRISM covers a broad spectrum of critical areas necessary for high-performing, resilient software delivery teams, unlike other frameworks that may focus narrowly on specific aspects.
- Seven Key Pillars: The framework's organization into seven pillars ensures a comprehensive evaluation of team maturity and performance.
- Actionable Metrics and KPIs: PRISM provides specific metrics and KPIs for each pillar, offering clear, actionable insights for improvement.
- Experience-Driven: The framework is rooted in real-world experience from working with diverse organizations, making it practical and relevant.
- Focus on Resilience: PRISM emphasizes not just performance but also the resilience of software delivery teams, ensuring they can withstand and adapt to various challenges and changes.

These elements make PRISM a robust and effective framework for driving excellence in software delivery teams.
